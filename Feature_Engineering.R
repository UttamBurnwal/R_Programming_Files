#A dummy column is one which has a value of one when a categorical event occurs and a zero 
#when it doesnâ€™t occur. In most cases this is a feature of the event/person/object being described.

#In the function dummy_cols, the names of these new columns are concatenated to the original 
#column and separated by an underscore.

#The final option for dummy_cols() is remove_first_dummy which by default is FALSE. 
#If TRUE, it removes the first dummy variable created from each column.
